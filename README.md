## Project Description
Swapify is a peer-to-peer trustless NFT swap dapp. It allows user to put NFTs they want to swap for offer, other users can then make offers (ERC721 and/or ERC20).The party that created the swap will then be able to accept the swap, and if they donâ€™t accept the other party will be able to counter-propose by adding more/different NFTs or topping the offer with ERC20. When both parties are happy, the swap-creator will be able to accept, and the NFTs will be safely swapped.

## Swap flow example
1. Alice has a bored ape that she wants to swap, she put it on offer along with a description : *Looking for a Doodle or a very rare Alien fren*
2. Bob sees the offer and propose his Alien fren and a Cool Cat and 20 WETH.
3. Alice likes the Alien but given the floor prices of the collection, she comments on the swap asking for a better offer.
4. Bob adds 20WETH to top the offer.
5. Alice accept, and items are swapped.


## Already Implemented
- Swap contract supporting ERC721 and ERC20.
- Front-end swaps/offer pages, discover feed and profile page.

## On the road map
We would like to play on the social aspect of the project:
 - Add possibility for users to comment/like/share swap after signing in with their Ethereum address.
 - Feature hottest swaps on the discover feed.
 - Add premium accounts feature, where user can pay a fee to have their swaps feature on top of the discover feed.
